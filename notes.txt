form - input, select, text area
text, email, number these are types of input

div is a block level alement! whatever you put in div takes up that entire area

--> label e for field e ja dibo that must go as an id in the input field
email: user@domain.domainextension

number: can that 'e' only, rest are number

**form control makes input column 100%! so cols is unchangeable
text area's row can be changed, but chaangign column won't work if form control is used

**selected attribute** appears on option field first by default
using disabled with this will not allow anyone to use the "disable selected" option


--> the value field is for the backend, takes whatever is written to the backend
whatever we write on the form is a value that is taken to the server
value won't work in text-area

more like a nested option:

accept="image/*" means we wont be taking anything except images (*means all)
